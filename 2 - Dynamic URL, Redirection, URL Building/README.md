### Dynamic URL
Dynamic URLs allow the server to handle multiple URL patterns with similar structures. This is typically achieved using variables within the URL path that can be extracted and used within the handler function. It enables the creation of RESTful APIs where resources are accessed and manipulated using URLs.

### Redirection
Redirection is the process of directing a client to a different URL. It is commonly used for several purposes:
- Redirecting to a different route after a form submission.
- Handling moved resources.
- URL shortening services.
Redirection involves sending an HTTP response with a status code indicating the redirection (usually 302 or 301) and the target URL.

### URL Building
URL building is the process of generating URLs within the application. This is useful for creating links, redirecting to different parts of the application, and ensuring that the URLs are always correct even if the routing changes. 

### Complex Code Examples

#### Flask

##### Dynamic URL with Multiple Parameters
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/products/<int:category_id>/<string:product_name>')
def get_product(category_id, product_name):
    return jsonify({
        'category_id': category_id,
        'product_name': product_name
    })

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, the URL `/products/123/laptop` would call the `get_product` function with `category_id` as `123` and `product_name` as `laptop`.

##### Redirection with URL Parameters
```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/old-product/<int:product_id>')
def old_product(product_id):
    return redirect(url_for('new_product', product_id=product_id))

@app.route('/new-product/<int:product_id>')
def new_product(product_id):
    return f'Product {product_id} has been moved to the new URL.'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, accessing `/old-product/456` will redirect the client to `/new-product/456`.

##### URL Building for Complex Routes
```python
from flask import Flask, url_for, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/user/<username>/posts/<int:post_id>')
def show_post(username, post_id):
    return jsonify({
        'username': username,
        'post_id': post_id
    })

@app.route('/generate-post-url/<username>/<int:post_id>')
def generate_post_url(username, post_id):
    url = url_for('show_post', username=username, post_id=post_id)
    return jsonify({'url': url})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

In this example, the `/generate-post-url/johndoe/5` endpoint will generate a URL for the `show_post` endpoint dynamically.

### Summary

- **Dynamic URLs**: Enable flexible and reusable routes by using parameters within the URL.
- **Redirection**: Useful for guiding users to different routes, maintaining resource integrity, and simplifying URL structures.
- **URL Building**: Essential for generating accurate URLs within your application, supporting maintainable and scalable code.

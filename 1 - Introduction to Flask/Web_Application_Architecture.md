# How Web Works â€“ Web Application Architecture

For many years, we have been browsing our favorite websites and receiving quick responses to our queries. But have you ever wondered how each part of the application works together and how requests are processed behind the scenes? If you have some technical knowledge, you might know that your request goes to the web server, which processes it and performs all backend logic before sending a response back to your browser. While this is true, a deeper look reveals a complex architecture of different components and layers working together.

## Web Application Architecture

### Principles of Web Application Development

When building a web application, keep these principles in mind:

1. **User Perspective**: The application should be user-friendly and address their problems.
2. **Business Perspective**: The application should align with its market fit.
3. **Engineering Perspective**: The application should be scalable, functional, and able to handle high traffic loads.

### What is Web Application Architecture?

A web application is a program that runs on a browser with these characteristics:
- Addresses a specific problem or provides information.
- Interactive like a desktop application.
- Works with a Content Management System (CMS).

Traditionally, websites were static pages, but modern web applications consist of both static and dynamic pages.

Web application architecture defines how the components of an application communicate with each other. It involves various components like user interfaces, middleware systems, databases, servers, and browsers. It ensures reliability, scalability, security, and robustness to handle global network traffic.

### How Does a Web Request Work?

1. **Entering a URL**: When you type a URL (e.g., flipkart.com) in your browser, it sends a request to a DNS to find the server's IP address. The browser then sends the request to this IP address using the HTTPS protocol.
2. **Processing the Request**: The web server processes the request and uses Business Logic to route data access and workflow.
3. **Getting the Response**: The server sends back the response, which is displayed on your screen as the web page's front end.

### How Does Web Application Architecture Work?

Web applications run on both the client-side and server-side:

- **Client-side code**: Runs in the browser based on user inputs, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Server-side code**: Runs on the server, responds to HTTP requests, and is written in languages like Python, JavaScript, C#, PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc.

### Web Application Architecture Components

1. **User Interface App Components**: Related to the user interface/experience, including display, dashboards, logs, notifications, and settings.
2. **Structural Components**: Concerned with the application's functionality, control, and database storage, including:
   - The web browser or client.
   - The web application server.
   - The database server.

### Web Application Three-Tier Architecture Layers

Web application architecture is typically divided into multiple layers or tiers, known as Three-Tier Architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Accessible to the client via a browser, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Business Layer**: Handles business logic, processes user requests, and manages data access routes.
3. **Persistence Layer**: Manages data storage and access, closely connected to the business layer for optimized data retrieval.

### Additional Components

- **Cross-cutting code**: Manages communications, operations, and security, affecting all parts of the system.
- **Third-party integrations**: Incorporates external APIs for payment gateways, social logins, etc.

### Types of Web Application Architecture

1. **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**: Modern web applications that update content on the current page without reloading. They use AJAX for faster interactions.
2. **Microservices**: Small, lightweight services executing specific functions, allowing developers to use different programming languages and enhancing productivity.
3. **Serverless Architectures**: Outsource server and infrastructure management to third-party cloud services, allowing developers to focus on custom logic without managing infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Understanding web application architecture is crucial for developing robust, scalable, and efficient applications. Modern web apps continue to evolve, and the right architecture is key to future expansion and scalability. Explore the requirements and goals before starting the development process to ensure a successful web application.
